<h2>About Photo-Filter-In-Css üñºÔ∏è</h2>
<p>The CSS filter property provides access to effects like blur or color shifting on an element's rendering before the element is displayed. Filters are commonly used to adjust the rendering of an image, a background, or a border. There are a number of functions to use for the value: blur()</p>

<p>The CSS filter property is one of the most popular ways of adding effects to images or any HTML elements. It allows us to use several functions to apply graphical effects like blur, saturation, or color shift to an element.</p>

<p>o add images to a page, we use the <img> inline element. The <img> element is a self-containing, or empty, element, which means that it doesn't wrap any other content and it exists as a single tag. For the <img> element to work, a src attribute and value must be included to specify the source of the image.</p>
